# A/B Testing with Cookie Cats Game üéÆüç™

## Project Overview
This project focuses on A/B testing in the popular mobile game **Cookie Cats**. The primary goal is to evaluate the impact of altering the level progression flow on player retention. The game introduced an in-game gate that blocks progress after a certain number of levels, and we analyze two groups: one where the gate appears early and another where it appears later.

## Problem Statement
The question we aim to answer is: **Does the placement of the gate affect player retention and engagement?** Using data collected from both groups of players, we test whether the placement impacts how long users stay engaged with the game.

## Data
The dataset includes:
- Player IDs
- Retention data (1-day and 7-day)
- Information on when the gate was introduced (early or late)

## Tools & Techniques
- **Python**: For data analysis and visualization
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization
- **SciPy**: For statistical testing
- **A/B Testing**: To compare retention between the two groups

## Analysis Process
1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding and cleaning the dataset.
2. **Retention Metrics**: Comparing 1-day and 7-day retention between the two player groups.
3. **Hypothesis Testing**: Conducting statistical tests to determine if the difference in retention is significant.
4. **Conclusions**: Summarizing insights on whether changing the gate's placement improves player retention.

## Results
The results of the A/B test help the game developers decide the optimal point for the gate to improve player engagement without negatively impacting retention.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides data-driven insights into how minor design changes in mobile games can significantly influence player behavior and overall game success.
