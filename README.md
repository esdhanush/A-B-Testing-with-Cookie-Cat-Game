As players progress through the game they will encounter gates that force them to wait some time before they can progress or make an 
in-app purchase. In this project, we will analyze the result of an AB-test where the first gate in Cookie Cats was moved from level 30 to 
level 40. In particular, we will analyze the impact on player retention.
